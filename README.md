# My Python Backend Projects Collection

Welcome to my central repository for small backend projects built with Python. This repository serves as a portfolio and a personal library of the various micro-projects, APIs, and scripts I've created.

Each project is self-contained within its own folder and has its own `README.md` file with specific details and instructions.

* **[Snake, Water, Gun Game](./snake_water_gun_game/)** - A simple, classic command-line game where you play against the computer. A great example of basic Python logic and user input.
